This is a final case study capstone project for Google Data Analytics Certificate.

This case study is about a bike sharing company, Cyclistic, that would like to design a marketing strategies to covert casual riders into annual members.  The data analysis process involved the analyzing the Cyclistic trip data from the previous 12 months (https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) to identify the differentiation of Cyclistic bikes usage habit between Casual Riders and Cyclistic Members. The process entails, importing the previous 12 months data into a consolidated data frame, clean the data frame will invalid data, adding ride duration, trip distance, and day of week data, perform descriptive analysis on the cleaned consolidated data, aggregate the for average trip duration/number of rides/average trip distance, and export the data for data visualization purpose.

Furthermore, to get insight on the data, data visualization on average duration and number of rides were performed.  This allows the business is understand how Casual Riders and Cyclistic Members are differ, what causes the different, and how to close this usage gap between Casual Riders and Cyclistic Members.  Additionally, 

And the finding indicated there is a significant usage gap between Casual Rider and Cyclistic Member during the weekdays. This might be contributed by different habit/behavior is bike usage, i.e., based on the data Cyclistic Member ridership is constant throughout the week which might indicates that they are using the bikes for their daily commute. As for Casual Rider, we only see a usage number flipped during weekends time, thus this indicates they are using the bike for leisure purpose.
